**A userscript client for Miniblox (NOT A HACK CLIENT)**

</div>

## Overview

Eclipse Client is a userscript designed to enhance the Miniblox experience.  It's not a hack client, instead it adds convenient features for players.  This project is a userscript, which means it runs directly within your web browser and interacts with the Miniblox website.

By downloading, accessing, or using this software (the "Software"), you agree to the terms and conditions outlined in [the EULA](EULA.md).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, etc.) supporting userscripts.
- A userscript manager (e.g., Violentmonkey, Tampermonkey).

### Installation

1. **Install a userscript manager:**  Download and install a userscript manager extension for your browser (Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey are popular choices).

2. **Install Eclipse Client:**  Go to this repository's releases section.

3. **Enable the script:** In your userscript manager, make sure the Eclipse Client script is enabled.

4. **Visit Miniblox:** Visit the Miniblox website.  The Eclipse Client userscript should automatically load.

5. **Lurker Collab** For the Eclipse Client and Public Lurker collab all you have to do is have both Lurker and Eclipse Client installed at the same time for it to activate.
